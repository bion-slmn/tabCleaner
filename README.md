# Tab Manager

**Tab Manager** is a Chrome extension designed to help users manage memory usage and keep the number of open tabs under control. By automatically grouping inactive or extra tabs, it enhances browser performance and provides a more organized browsing experience.

## Features

- **Inactivity Management**: Tabs are monitored for inactivity, and after a set period of time, they are placed in the "Inactive Tabs" group. This reduces memory usage by freeing resources allocated to those tabs, improving overall browser performance.
  
- **Extra Tabs Group**: When the number of open tabs exceeds the user-defined maximum, the least-used tabs are automatically moved to an "Extra Tabs" group. This ensures that your active tabs remain easy to access, while keeping extra, less-used tabs in a separate group.

- **Tab Reactivation**: If a tab that is placed in the "Inactive Tabs" or "Extra Tabs" group is reactivated (clicked on by the user), it will automatically be removed from its group and restored as an active tab.

## How It Works

1. **Inactivity Detection**: Each tab is checked for inactivity. After a specified period of inactivity (set by the user), the tab is grouped under "Inactive Tabs" to free up memory.
   
2. **Max Tab Limit**: Users can set a maximum number of active tabs. Once this limit is exceeded, the least-used tabs are moved to the "Extra Tabs" group for easy management.
   
3. **Automatic Tab Grouping**: The extension automatically moves inactive or extra tabs to their respective groups, keeping your active tabs organized and ensuring your browser remains responsive.

## User Settings

The extension allows customization of the following settings:

- **Max Tabs**: Set the maximum number of tabs that can remain active before extra tabs are grouped.
- **Inactive Tab Color**: Choose a color for the tabs in the "Inactive Tabs" group.
- **Extra Tab Color**: Choose a color for the tabs in the "Extra Tabs" group.
- **Inactivity Time**: Define the number of minutes a tab can remain idle before being moved to the "Inactive Tabs" group.

## How to Use

1. After installation, the Tab Manager will begin monitoring your open tabs.
2. You can adjust the settings via the extension's settings page to suit your browsing preferences.
3. Tabs that exceed the maximum tab count or remain inactive for too long will be grouped, allowing for easy access and improved performance.
4. Any tab that is reactivated will be automatically moved out of its group and restored to your active tabs.

With **Tab Manager**, you can ensure a faster, more efficient Chrome browsing experience by managing your tabs and freeing up memory automatically!
